/**
 * A simple facade for the class Point2D.Double - a class that represents
 * a point in 2D space with Double precision.
 * This is only here to save you some typing so that you can construct points like this:
 * 
 * Point p = new Point(x,y);
 * rather than:
 * Point2D.Double p = new Point2D.Double(x,y);
 * 
 * You should look up the Point2D.Double documentation though to see what methods this inherits..
 * Of particular interest to you will be the method:
 * 
 * double distance(Point2D)
 * 
 * which returns the distance between this Point and the one provided to the method.
 * 
 * the toString method has been overridden so it prints something reasonable.
 * The default Point2D.Double toString method prints too much stuff.
